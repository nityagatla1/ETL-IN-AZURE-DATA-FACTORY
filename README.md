# ETL-IN-AZURE-DATA-FACTORY


This project leverages COVID-19 data from the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) to build a comprehensive cloud-based ELT pipeline. The goal is to provide actionable insights into the spread of COVID-19 and its impact on healthcare systems across Europe. 

Using a variety of Azure resources—Azure Data Factory for data ingestion, Azure Data Lake Gen2 and Blob Storage for scalable storage, Azure SQL Database for structured data management, and Azure Databricks for processing large datasets—this project transforms raw data into meaningful insights. The data is sourced directly from ECDC's COVID-19 case and death records in CSV format.

Key analyses focus on:
- **Case Positivity Trends**: Visualizing the rise in COVID-19 positivity rates across different European regions.
- **Mortality and Health System Strain**: Exploring the relationship between the number of positive cases, death rates, and hospital occupancy, helping to forecast healthcare needs.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Using the cleaned and processed data to build models that can predict the rise in COVID-19 cases and better inform healthcare resource management.

Power BI dashboards are used for data visualization, displaying metrics such as positivity-to-death ratios and hospital occupancy across countries. This project showcases the power of data engineering and business intelligence in addressing real-world health crises, helping data scientists and decision-makers to optimize responses and mitigate the effects of the pandemic.
